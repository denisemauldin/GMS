The Genome Management System (GMS) is a Ruby on Rails website with a MySQL backend running 
on Apache using Passenger that helps to organize the metadata for whole genome sequencing.  
It is currently designed and set up to support Complete Genomics files, but has some 
support for generic VCF files.  An associated pipeline to load data into GMS and an 
associated perl module to retrieve data from GMS will be available soon.
