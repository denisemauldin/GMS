  <h1>Failures</h1>
  <p>Some errors were generated in creating the linker tables (Memberships or Acquisitions).  Check that people were properly added to the correct pedigree, that samples were assigned to the right person, that disease diagnoses were added to the correct person, and that relationships between people in the pedigree are correct.</p>
  <p>If you're getting errors about Person not being found (Memberships or Acquisitions) then check your identifiers and <b>upload again</b> if the proper relationships don't show up in the pedigree page.</p>
